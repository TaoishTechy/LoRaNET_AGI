# AgriTech Drone Project Overview:
The agricultural maintenance drone is designed to automate various tasks in agriculture, such as irrigation, crop monitoring, precision agriculture, smart fertilizer dispensing, weed detection, and remote field surveillance. The drone is equipped with a variety of sensors, including soil moisture, weather, GPS, DHT11 for temperature and humidity, capacitive soil moisture, ultrasonic sensors, and a camera. It also features a 4-channel relay for controlling the drone's flight and implementing a collision avoidance algorithm.

Weather station data influences irrigation decisions.

### Crop Monitoring:
ESP32S3 on the drone captures images of the crops.
Images are processed for crop health analysis.

### Precision Agriculture:
GPS module enables accurate field mapping.
Soil nutrient sensors guide precise fertilization.

### Smart Fertilizer Dispenser:
Soil nutrient sensors determine fertilizer needs.
Automated dispenser dispenses precise amounts of fertilizer.

### Weed Detection:
Camera with image recognition identifies weeds.
ESP32S3 controls the weeding mechanism for weed removal.

### Remote Field Surveillance:
Camera system with motion sensors monitors field security.
LoRa alerts sent for unauthorized access.

### Flight Control and Collision Avoidance:
4-channel relay controls rotor speeds for drone flight.
Ultrasonic sensors provide distance measurements for collision detection.
Collision avoidance algorithm adjusts drone movement based on sensor data.

## Important Notes:
Ensure proper power distribution and management to meet the power requirements of all components.
Consider the weight and balance of the drone to optimize flight stability.

Fine-tune the collision avoidance algorithm based on real-world testing and drone characteristics.
Implement safety features and fail-safes to handle unexpected situations during drone operation.
