Camera with image recognition identifies weeds.
ESP32S3 controls the weeding mechanism for weed removal.

### Remote Field Surveillance: (To be added)
Camera system with motion sensors monitors field security.
LoRa alerts sent for unauthorized access.

### Flight Control and Collision Avoidance:
4-channel relay controls rotor speeds for drone flight.
Ultrasonic sensors provide distance measurements for collision detection.
Collision avoidance algorithm adjusts drone movement based on sensor data.

## Important Notes:
Ensure proper power distribution and management to meet the power requirements of all components.
Consider the weight and balance of the drone to optimize flight stability.

Fine-tune the collision avoidance algorithm based on real-world testing and drone characteristics.
Implement safety features and fail-safes to handle unexpected situations during drone operation.
