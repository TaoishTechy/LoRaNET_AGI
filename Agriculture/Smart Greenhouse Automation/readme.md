## LoRa Communication:

Utilizes LoRa RF Module for communication.
Sends sensor data to the server node.

## Error Handling:

Attempts to send data to the server and handles failures (e.g., stores data locally).

## Delay:

Introduces a delay between sensor readings.

## Sensor Node Wiring Guidelines

The length of wires in a sensor node can significantly impact the quality of data transfer, influenced by factors such as resistance, capacitance, and electromagnetic interference. Successful wiring is crucial for reliable sensor readings. Here are some guidelines to consider:

## Sensor Wiring Considerations

## Analog Sensors

- **Consider Resistance:** Longer wires for analog sensors (e.g., temperature sensors) can introduce resistance, leading to voltage drop and affecting measurement accuracy.
- **Optimal Length:** Keep wire length below a few meters for analog signals to maintain signal integrity.
- **Enhance for Distance:** For longer distances, consider using signal conditioning or differential signal transmission methods.

## Digital Sensors

- **Higher Tolerance:** Digital sensors (e.g., I2C or SPI sensors) are generally more tolerant of longer wires compared to analog sensors.
- **Watch Capacitance:** As wire length increases, the capacitance may affect signal integrity. Keep I2C and SPI wire lengths within a few meters for reliable communication.

## Power and Ground Wires

- **Voltage Drop Consideration:** Long power and ground wires can introduce voltage drops, impacting the reliability of sensor readings.
- **Use Thick Wires:** Utilize sufficiently thick wires to minimize resistance, especially for sensors that draw significant current.

## Shielding

- **Minimize Interference:** Consider using shielded cables, especially in environments with high electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- **Protect Signal Integrity:** Shielding helps reduce the impact of external interference on the sensor signals.

## Wire Type

- **Environmental Suitability:** Choose wire types suitable for the environment (e.g., outdoor-rated for outdoor installations).
- **Consider Twisted-Pair Cables:** Twisted-pair cables can help reduce electromagnetic interference.

## Communication Protocols

- **Robust Protocols:** For longer distances, choose communication protocols that are robust and designed for reliable data transfer over extended lengths.
- **Example Protocol:** RS-485 is an example of a protocol suitable for longer distances.

## Wire Quality

- **Prioritize Quality:** High-quality wires with low resistance and capacitance are preferable for longer distances.

Consider these guidelines when designing the wiring for your sensor node to ensure accurate and reliable data transfer.
