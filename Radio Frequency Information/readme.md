| **Lower Frequencies**  | Lower frequencies, such as those used in 4G LTE networks, offer better coverage and penetration through obstacles like buildings and trees. They are suitable for providing broad coverage in both urban and rural areas.          | Lower frequencies typically have lower data transfer rates compared to higher frequencies. This limitation may become a bottleneck as the demand for faster data speeds increases.                                                     |
| **Increased Compression** | Improved compression techniques can enhance the efficiency of data transmission, allowing more data to be sent in the available bandwidth.                                                        | While compression is useful, there are limits to how much it can compensate for the demand for higher data speeds. Additionally, more advanced compression techniques may introduce additional complexity and processing requirements. |
| **Spectrum Allocation**   | The availability of different frequency bands allows for spectrum allocation based on the specific needs of a network. For example, higher frequencies like those used in 5G can provide high data rates in densely populated areas. | Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, which means they have reduced coverage and may be more susceptible to obstacles. This necessitates a denser network infrastructure, with more small cells and antennas.  |
